These are my solutions to [codewars](http://codewars.com) [code katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)). My profile in codewars can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/CarlosPProjects). Languages used here are (at the moment): 

* JavaScript (mainly)
* PHP (gradually)
* Java (slowly increasing)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This repo includes my own solutions and just posting them helps me to improve as a developer. But..., **please do not use them** to cheat on the platform! :)

Thank you!
